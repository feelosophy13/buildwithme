Here are some good responses on <a href="www.quora.com/How-can-I-validate-my-startup-idea-without-someone-stealing-it" target="_blank">Quora</a> and <a href="www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1oo2zx/should_i_tell_people_about_my_startup_ideas/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> that address your concern.
